Dynamic Clock on SSD Using Internal Timer
Introduction
This project focuses on implementing a dynamic clock feature on a Solid State Drive (SSD) by leveraging its internal timer. The dynamic clock updates in real-time and is integrated directly into the SSD's firmware or through manufacturer APIs. This repository provides a comprehensive guide and implementation for those interested in utilizing internal timers for advanced SSD functionalities.

Project Overview
The dynamic clock project aims to showcase how to:

Access and configure the internal timer of an SSD.
Integrate a real-time clock within the SSD’s firmware or through available APIs.
Implement a system that continuously updates and displays the current time without impacting SSD performance.
Features
Real-Time Clock: Maintains and displays the current time dynamically.
Internal Timer Access: Utilizes the SSD’s internal timer to ensure accurate timekeeping.
Firmware Integration: Code examples and instructions for integrating the clock into SSD firmware.
Performance Monitoring: Ensures that the dynamic clock feature does not adversely affect SSD performance or reliability.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Hardware: SSD with internal timer functionality.
Software: Firmware access tools, manufacturer APIs, or development environment compatible with the SSD’s firmware.
Knowledge: Understanding of SSD architecture, firmware programming, and API usage.
